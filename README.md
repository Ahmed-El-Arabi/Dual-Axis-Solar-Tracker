# Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System
## System Description

A Dual-Axis Solar tracking system made specially for Concentrating collectors, specifically for parabolic dish collectors. The algorithm outputs the sun location in terms of Solar Azimuth and Zenith angles given the time and location.

The project is still a work in progress, what was developed so far is the code in C for the algorithm.
